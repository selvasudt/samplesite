        <h1>Content Heading</h1>
        <article>
          Both versions convey a topic; it’s pretty easy to predict that the
          paragraph will be about epidemiological evidence, but only the second
          version establishes an argumentative point and puts it in context. The
          paragraph doesn’t just describe the epidemiological evidence; it shows
          how epidemiology is telling the same story as etiology. Similarly,
          while Version A doesn’t relate to anything in particular, Version B
          immediately suggests that the prior paragraph addresses the biological
          pathway (i.e. etiology) of a disease and that the new paragraph will
          bolster the emerging hypothesis with a different kind of evidence. As
          a reader, it’s easy to keep track of how the paragraph about cells and
          chemicals and such relates to the paragraph about populations in
          different places. A last thing to note about key sentences is that
          academic readers expect them to be at the beginning of the paragraph.
          (The first sentence this paragraph is a good example of this in
          action!) This placement helps readers comprehend your argument. To see
          how, try this: find an academic piece (such as a textbook or scholarly
          article) that strikes you as well written and go through part of it
          reading just the first sentence of each paragraph. You should be able
          to easily follow the sequence of logic. When you’re writing for
          professors, it is especially effective to put your key sentences first
          because they usually convey your own original thinking. It’s a very
          good sign when your paragraphs are typically composed of a telling key
          sentence followed by evidence and explanation. Knowing this convention
          of academic writing can help you both read and write more effectively.
          When you’re reading a complicated academic piece for the first time,
          you might want to go through reading only the first sentence or two of
          each paragraph to get the overall outline of the argument. Then you
          can go back and read all of it with a clearer picture of how each of
          the details fit in. And when you’re writing, you may also find it
          useful to write the first sentence of each paragraph (instead of a
          topic-based outline) to map out a thorough argument before getting
          immersed in sentence-level wordsmithing.
