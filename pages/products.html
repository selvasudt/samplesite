          Both versions convey a topic; it’s pretty easy to predict that the
          paragraph will be about epidemiological evidence, but only the second
          version establishes an argumentative point and puts it in context. The
          paragraph doesn’t just describe the epidemiological evidence; it shows
          how epidemiology is telling the same story as etiology. Similarly,
          while Version A doesn’t relate to anything in particular, Version B
          immediately suggests that the prior paragraph addresses the biological
          pathway (i.e. etiology) of a disease and that the new paragraph will
          bolster the emerging hypothesis with a different kind of evidence.

          a reader, it’s easy to keep track of how the paragraph about cells and
          chemicals and such relates to the paragraph about populations in
          different places. A last thing to note about key sentences is that
          academic readers expect them to be at the beginning of the paragraph.
          (The first sentence this paragraph is a good example of this in
          action!) This placement helps readers comprehend your argument.
